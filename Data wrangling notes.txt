DAY 2
DAY 3

==================

Check total data size on CF or SD card against the transferred files on hard drives (number of GBs). See that they're equal.

5 spot checks (per 100 files).
Watch beginning, scrub through and watch end.

Don't bow to pressure to turn over cards to be formatted too quickly before checking data.

Tell the person to which you're handing the card to be formatted that this card (w green tape) is OK to format. Verbal confirmation. Don't be ambiguous about it ("this is OK"). Tell them explicitly: "This is OK to format".
